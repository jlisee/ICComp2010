About
=====

This is an unfinished set of code from the Robotics Institute 2010 immigration 
course.  It's purpose was to take the positions of balls on a game board and
broadcast them over bluetooth to a set of NXT bricks allowing players to better
reason about the competition environment.  Development was halted when the NXT
bluetooth proved to flaky for the task.

What it does have is some basic examples of UDP multicast in python and
producer consumer multithreading to handling sending out data to multiple 
bluetooth devices.


Dependencies
============

Needed packages
---------------
 * python-serial (serial libary for talking to the NXT over bluetooth)
 * python-protobuf (serialization lib for handling vision messages)
 * python-pyinotify (watches dev directory for new bluetooth devices)
 * ssl-vision (needed to see target balls in arena)
 
Install commands
----------------
For the python packages::

  sudo apt-get install python-protobuf python-serial python-pyinotify

For ssl-vision follow the instruction in the deps/ssl-vision directory.


Generating the Protocol Buffer Files
====================================
Run the "genproto.sh" script from the root directory.  These are used to 
communicate with ssl-vision and receive ball positions.
